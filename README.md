A custodial service that lets you easily distribute Monero to newbees and others.

1. Visit the website,
2. create a new link,
3. pay Monero to the subaddress,
4. send the link to the recipient.

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment

   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install cherrypy, requests and qrcode
   ```
   pip install cherrypy qrcode requests
   ```

## ATTENTION

The code is very cringe. I'm still a beginner and this is the first version.
